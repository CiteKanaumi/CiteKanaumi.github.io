The dominant approach for many NLP

tasks are recurrent neural networks, in par-
ticular LSTMs, and convolutional neural

networks. However, these architectures
are rather shallow in comparison to the
deep convolutional networks which have

pushed the state-of-the-art in computer vi-
sion. We present a new architecture (VD-
CNN) for text processing which operates

directly at the character level and uses

only small convolutions and pooling oper-
ations. We are able to show that the per-
formance of this model increases with the

depth: using up to 29 convolutional layers,

we report improvements over the state-of-
the-art on several public text classification

tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that very deep convolutional
nets have been applied to text processing.
