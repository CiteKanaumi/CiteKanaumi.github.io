The researchers present a new architecture (very deep convolutional neural networks / VDCNN) for text processing which operates directly at the character level and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. The researchers are able to show that the performance of this model increases with the depth: using up to 29 convolutional layers, the researchers report improvements over the state-ofthe- art on several public text classification tasks.
