In this paper, we propose to use deep architectures of many convolutional layers to ap- proach this goal, using up to 29 layers.<br>
The proposed deep convolutional network shows significantly better results than previous ConvNets approach.<br>
The paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions for very deep approach in Natural Language Processing(NLP).
