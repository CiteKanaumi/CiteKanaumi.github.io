This paper is structured as follows. There have
been previous attempts to use ConvNets for text
processing. We summarize the previous works in
the next section and discuss the relations and differences.
Our architecture is described in detail
in section 3. We have evaluated our approach on
several sentence classification tasks, initially proposed
by (Zhang et al., 2015). These tasks and
our experimental results are detailed in section 4.
The proposed deep convolutional network shows
significantly better results than previous ConvNets
approach. The paper concludes with a discussion
of future research directions for very deep approach
in NLP.
