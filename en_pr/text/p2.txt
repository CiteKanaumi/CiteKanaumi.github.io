The researchers thought that neural network with convolution can analyze text fastly. And omre convolutions accelerate analysis.<br>
So, they propose to use deep architectures of many convolutional layers to approach this goal, using up to 29 layers.<br>
The proposed VDCNN(very deep convolutional neural networks) significantly better results than previous CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) approach.<br>
