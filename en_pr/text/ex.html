One of the basic goals of a functional regression model is to predict the value of the response variable Y for a given
trajectory of the input process X . Then, a sensible approach for variable selection is to choose the p points X (t1 ), . . . , X (tp ) that give the best linear prediction (in the sense of the L2 norm) of Y . This implies to find the vector Tp that minimizes the function
