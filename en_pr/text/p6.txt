In 29 levels of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), the precision that is better than a conventional model is provided.<br>
It is the first trial that an advantage of the depth was shown in natural language processing.<br>
We put a focus only for the sentence classification work by this experiment.<br>
It is necessary to investigate other fields of the natural language processing.<br>
