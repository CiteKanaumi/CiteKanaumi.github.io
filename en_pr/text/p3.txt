We have explored four depths for
our networks: 9, 17, 29 and 49, which we define
as being the number of convolutional layers.
The depth of a network is obtained by summing
the number of blocks with 64, 128, 256 and
512 filters, with each block containing two convolutional
layers. In Figure 1, the network has
2 blocks of each type, resulting in a depth of
2 * (2 + 2 + 2 + 2) = 16. Adding the very first
convolutional layer, this sums to a depth of 17 convolutional
layers. The depth can thus be increased
or decreased by adding or removing convolutional
blocks with a certain number of filters. The best
configurations we observed for depths 9, 17, 29
and 49 are described in Table 2. We also give the
number of parameters of all convolutional layers.
