<b>Methodology</b><br>
The researchers have explored four depths for our networks: 9, 17, 29 and 49, which the researchers define as being the number of convolutional layers. The depth of a network is obtained by summing the number of blocks with 64, 128, 256 and 512 filters, with each block containing two convolutional layers. <br>
